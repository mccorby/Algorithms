# Algorithms Part I
This repository includes the code examples and exercises provided in the course "Algorithms" from Princeton University in Coursera
This is a must course to do taught by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

The code is written in Kotlin. This is a difference with the language used in the course (Java). This way the practice is double

In order to show how some algorithms are built, the idiomatic Kotlin equivalent is, sometimes, missing
Where possible, the Kotlin idiom is implemented alongside a comment with the original code
